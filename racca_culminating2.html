        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            <p>I'm <strong>Christian James Racca</strong>. I'm a 17-year-old resident of Queensville Subdivision, Bagumbong, Caloocan City. 
            My hobbies include online gaming, playing basketball, fixing bikes and motorcycles, and exploring photography and editing. 
            I love capturing moments and enhancing them through my editing skills. 
            In addition to my personal interests, I'm actively involved in my community and church. 
            I currently serve as the Director of Events and Recreation Officer for the Ministry of the Altar Servers at Sto. Ni√±o de Congreso Parish. 
            In this role, I've organized and successfully executed several impactful events, such as feeding programs for malnourished children, Christmas parties, Parish Youth Day, and Altar Servers Month, among others. 
            These experiences have helped me develop strong leadership and event planning skills while contributing to the betterment of my community. 
            I am also proud to be a <strong>Bronze Seal Bearer</strong> in my Grade 11 year and recognized as a <strong>Model Student</strong>, 
            which reflects my dedication to both academics and good character.</p>
